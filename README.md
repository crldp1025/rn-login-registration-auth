# Login, Registration and Authentication Mobile Application

This is project demonstrates user login, registration and authentication, created with [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) and Typescript.

You can use the Rest API that I created using NodeJS [here](https://github.com/crldp1025/nodejs-login-register-auth-api).
