# Login, Registration and Authentication Mobile Application

This is project demonstrates user login, registration and authentication, created with [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) and Typescript.
<p>This is just a  visual representation. You can still navigate between screens but there are no functions yet. I'm still developing the Rest API for this mobile app. I will include here the repository of the API once it's done. </p>
